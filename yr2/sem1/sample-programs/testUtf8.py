'''This program illustrates the way data is acutally represented in files
on the computer as opposed to the way users might preceive this by using
and viewing text files and, possibly, ignoring and/or misunderstanding
that which is invisible (encodings that don't have a glyph or 'character'
to represent them) or misunderstanding the fundamental difference between,
for example, '1', 1 and 1.0. The first important concept is that files (and
everthing else a computer deals with) are just a bunch of 1s and 0s which
are often visualised (in a viewer) in hexadecimal for convenience and brevity,

In this context, everything that we preceive as a character, printable or
not, is represented internally as a (somewhat arbitrary) number which can
be expressed in binary, decimal, octal, hexadecimal or whatever you're
having yourself.

For a fuller understanding of this, the reader is encouraged to learn about
text encoding systems. Start with the terms, ASCII, Unicode, UTF-8 and take
it from there.

Things get a little trickier when we start representing things which are
not modelled as 'characters' - integers, floats and boolean. We must now
consider such arcana as 'endian-ness', word sizes (32-bit, 64-bit etc),
floating point (IEEE 754) and more.

What this program does is to write this stuff to a file and read it back
so that you can view the file in it's 'real' form using a hex viewer, and
read it back and present the different types to your program in a more
'logical' mannner.

Have fun!

import struct

'''This module performs conversions between Python values and C structs
represented as Python bytes objects. This can be used in handling binary
data stored in files or from network connections, among other sources.
It uses Format Strings as compact descriptions of the layout of the C
structs and the intended conversion to/from Python values.

'''UTF_RANGE is a constant that we can adjust to give us any number of 'characters'
from the uttf-8 character set. In utf-8 (Python's default encoding) characters
are represented by 1 byte up to (realistically) 6 bytes. Good old-fashioned
ASCII maps seamlessy to the first 127 utf-8 characters. Beyond that 2 and
3-byte characters can represent prety muuch any character in any of the
World's languuages. A value of 65536 gives us all of the 1- 2- and 3-byte
representations.

INT_RANGE is the upper limit of a range of integers to represent.
FLOAT_RANGE is the upper limit range of the decimal portion of the float
that we want to represent, i.e 1.0 to 1.n where n
